# leJos_EV3_Azimuth_Movement
#  Description of the project
The task I've worked on was to implement azimuth movement for a lego-robot using PID controller.
What is an azimuth movement? It's keeping the indicated (planned) direction of movement and distance.

As a result I have a robot which go forward all the time(until you didn't press stop button) and, in case you take him off or turn,  returns to his initial trajectory.
To track angle deviation from the initial point I used Gyro sensor which works as hyroscope.
# Description of the work process (problems, solution)
My work consists of 4 main parts:
1) Firstly, I collected a robot from lego brigs(that was the most interesting part:))
2) Then, worked on software installation and establishment(I used leJos plugin on Eclipse IDE).
3) Wrote a code and test it on robot.
4) Finally, find out necessary coefficients.

Problems - mainly on sw installation part. I had big problem wih SD - several robots refused to see sw on it for running java lejos project, so it takes a long time - I just got another microSD that solved my problem. I spent really very big amount of time on the establishment, I could use it for coding.

As far as Control Theory is concerned, working with motors and overall robot was not complicated as well as with sensor but implementing PID was really challenging.

# Explanation of the result values (how you got them)
I got result values by practice - one-by-one I changed proportional, integration and derivative coefficients and test the program until I got good results in robot movement.

# Why I think this values are the best
Because when other values give very big deviations. Integrator is 0, because even making it 0.01 it gave very strange movements - the more it became, the more zigzag movemenets I got.
Proportional element reduce accuracy if it less or more than diaposone 5-7, whereas diffrentiator is good in the area of 20
